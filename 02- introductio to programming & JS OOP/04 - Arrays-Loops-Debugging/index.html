        <h1>arrays, loops, and debugging</h1>
        <dl>
            <dt>array</dt>
            <dd>used to reserved a block of location in memory, any array have a length which is denoted on the size of
                the reserved places number, array access this's places by using index , and array is a zero indexed.
                <br>
                <h2>creating array</h2>
                <p>intializing arrÿ¥y : <code>let arrayName = [];</code> <br>
                    adding data into the array : <code>arrayName[index]</code> = "value";
                </p>
                <pre>Example 
    <code>let info</code> = [] <code>;</code>
    <code>info[0]</code> = "john"<code>;</code>
    <code>info[1]</code> = 25<code>;</code>
    <code>info[2]</code> = "Gradeuated"<code>;</code>
    <code>info[3]</code> = "harvard"<code>;</code>

    Two Dimensional array
    <code>let employes</code> = [] <code>;</code>
    <code>info[0]</code> = ["Ali", 26,"front-end", 12000, true]<code>;</code>
    <code>info[1]</code> = ["sara", 24,"back-end", 11000, true]<code>;</code>
    <code>info[2]</code> = ["john", 27,"tester", 9000, false]<code>;</code>
    For accessing two dimenssional array we used <code>[index for parent][index for nested]</code>
                </pre>
                one of the differnces between arrays in js and in other programming language in array was created
                without determined the length of array in js (array in js is dynamic), and also in js array is mixed
                data type.
            </dd>
            <dt>loops</dt>
            <dd>
                used for making block of code for (n) times, js containg many of loops like:
                <ul>
                    <li><code>for</code> : looping through block of code for known number of time and known condition
                        <pre>Example: 
     <code>for</code> (<code>let i</code> = 0<code>;</code> <code>i</code> &lt; number of loops <code>i++</code>) {
        body of the loop
    }
                        </pre>
                    </li>
                    <li><code>while</code>: looping through blcok of code if the number of iteration is unknown, but i
                        know when i will stop so that while working with a conditio, and <code>while</code> will still
                        working while condition still true.
                        <pre>Example: 
    <code>while</code> (<code>condition</code>) {
        body of the loop
    }</pre>
                    </li>
                    <li><code>do... while</code>: like while but the diffrence is running the code for one time after
                        checking
                        condition.
                        <pre>Example: 
    <code>do</code> {
        body of the loop
    }<code> while </code>(<code>condition</code>)</pre>
                    </li>
                    <li><code>for... in</code>: like for but this used with the object to looping all porperites of the
                        object
                        <pre>Example
    <code>for</code> ( properity <code> in </code> objectName) {
        body of the loop
    }</pre>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                - when using loops it's not nessesary to making condition incremented by one, but this's is a counter we
                can increment with any value or dercement by any value all of this's denoted on the problem and
                algorithm of solution thi's problem, it's not iportant to start iteration with zero also it's denoted on
                problem and solving algorithm.

                <h2>stoping and breaking loops</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>break</code>: used for stoping loop, but it's not recomended to use.</li>
                    <li><code>continue</code>: used for skiping the iteration and start fro the next iteration</li>
                </ul>
                
            </dd>
            <dt>debugging</dt>
            <dd>you should test your code all the time in js we used debugger to showing our code running line by line
                by adding <code>debugger;</code>
            </dd>

                <h2>block scope vs local scope</h2>
                block scope this's means the scope inside a function <br>
                block scope this's means the scope in a [loop or condition]
