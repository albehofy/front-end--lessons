        <h1>Classes and Objects</h1>
        <dl>
            <dt>what's the differences between <code>classes</code> and <code>objects</code></dt>
            <dd>the <code>class</code> is the template or the blue print whuch the <code>object</code> created from,
                also we can say the <code>object</code> is the instance of the <code>class</code>.
                <h2>class</h2>
                is the blueprint or template from which objects are created , also class is a group of similar objects,
                denoted on logical entity, and doesn't allocated meory when it is created, and created for one time.
                <h2>object</h2>
                is an instance of the <code>class</code>, real world entity, (physicl entity) this's means every things
                you can touch is an <code>object</code>, also every <code>object</code> should created from a
                <code>class</code>, <code>objects</code> will having a different in the <code>properites</code> but
                having the same
                <code>methods, <code>object is allocated memmory when it's created, created many times as per requierment</code></code>
                <h2>ways of creating object of class</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Implicit object creation: <code>var</code> str = "new string in implicit object creation"; <br>
                        we called the creation in this's as a value type for the value (typeof this creation = type of
                        value), <br>
                        this's case working with the stack (first input will be the last ouput) we working with the
                        values.
                    </li>
                    <li>Explicit object creation: <code>var</code> str = <code>new</code> <code>String</code>("new
                        String in Explicit object creation"); <br>
                        we called the creation in this's as a reference type for the value (typeof this creation =
                        object becouse it's pointer on the reference in the memory)<br>
                        this's case working with the Heap (the way off arranged item is different about the stack) so
                        that we used the stack to taking the address of the data in the heap, and we accessed the
                        objects nd data in the heap by the addreess wich is in the stack, we used this's type of
                        creaction when we needed the value wtill updated with the value of the related address all the
                        time.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                the difference between implicit and Explicit ?
                - implicit is value type value.
                <pre>Example 
    <code>var</code> str = "hello, mr: Mohamed" <code>;</code>
    <code>console.log</code>(<code>typeof</code>(<code>str</code>)) <code>;</code> // string
                </pre>
                - explicit is reference type value
                <pre>Example 
    <code>var</code> strObject = <code>new</code> <code>String</code>("hello, mr: Mohamed")<code>;</code>
    <code>console.log</code>(<code>typeof</code>(<code>strObject</code>)) <code>;</code> // object
                </pre>
                for changing the value in the reference type (<code>String</code>) we used <code>method</code> called
                <code>valueOf</code>, becouse if we used equall sign (=) to change the value this will change the type
                into a permative type.

            <dd>we having 3 type of modifires, this's are used in <code>es7+</code>
                <ul>
                    <li>public: this's means thie class modifire can be accessed out of the class</li>
                    <li>private: for adding <code>private</code> modifire should adding <code>#</code> before the name
                        of this's modifire, and for working with the private member we adding <code>set</code> method,
                        and <code>get</code> method. <b>for Example</b> <code>#ID = 20329</code> this's means the class
                        modifire
                        can be accessed inside the class only, and the class
                        whose inherite from this's class can't access this's modifires</li>
                    <li>protected (<code>not supported in javaScript</code>): like private cant be shown out side the
                        class, and the class whose inherite from

            <dt>constructor</dt>
            <dd>is a special function in javaScript will excuting automatically when adding new object of the class to
                making intialization of this's class <br>
                for making constructor javaScript provided keywod called <code>constructor</code>, and we can adding
                parameter for the constructor.
                <pre>Example
    class Person {

                <ol>
                    <li> belong to each object of the class (their values changes for each member).</li>
                    <li> must be only called using an object form class.</li>
                </ol>
                <b>Static variables and Static Methods</b>
                for using static we adding <code>static</code> keyword before the prt of code which we want to make
                static
                <ol>
                    <li> belong to all class members (Have The Same Value For Each Object).</li>
                    <li> called using the class itself.</li>

                <h2>super()</h2>
                <p>when creating inheritance the <code>constructor</code> of the parent <code>class</code> are excuted
                    then excute the <code>constructor</code> of the child (this's running automatically) but in js
                    this's thing should handled by the developer so that we writing <code>super()</code> to excuting
                    patrent <code>constructor</code> <br>
                    when runing <code>super()</code> the value of the <code>parameter</code> of <code>constructor</code>
                    will be <code>undefined</code> but we can solve this's problem by adding the <code>value</code> of
                    the <b>child constructor</b> in the <code>super</code> lkie that <code>super(width, height)</code>
                    <br>
                    aslo we can used <code>super()</code> inside child <code>method</code> to excuting the
                    <code>method</code> of the parent after overriding this's <code>method</code>
                <pre>Example
    draw(){
        <code>super</code>.draw(); 
        console.log("overriding draw with new value");

                    </pre>
                </p>
                - also we can added new method inside the child class.

                all relation rounded about the members of <code>class</code> is an <code>object</code> of other

                <ul>
                    <li>association: the <code>class</code> having less dependent of the <code>object</code> which is
                        comming from another <code>classclass</code> and if this's <code>object deleted</code> this's
                        will not making a big different in this's <code>class</code> (optional info), like if we having
                        student <code>class</code> and this's <code>class</code> contain <code>object</code> called
                        department coming from another <code>class</code> this's department is an optional data in class
                        student in this's case (student aggregate department).</li>
                    <li>aggregation: this's <code>class</code> are contains some of <code>objects</code> making this's
                        <code>class</code> like a zoo having a group of animals, this's means
                        <code>zoo aggreated of animals</code> (special type of the association), but if i delete one of

                    <li>composition: special type of aggregation, this's <code>class</code> contains <code>object</code>
                        like aggregation but this's means this's object are main points in the <code>class</code> and if
                        any <code>object</code> are deleted this's means the <code>class</code> will stop working </li>
                    <li>inheritance: when i having a class inherite some <code>properites</code> or <code>methods</code>
                        from other <code>class</code> and also the child <code>class</code> having it's own
                        <code>properites</code> and <code>methods</code> <b>for Example</b> we having two classes A, and
                        B : class B having some <code>properites</code> and <code>methods</code> of a this's done using
                        <code>extends</code> keyword, <b>for explanation</b> a class B has an is a relationship with
                        <code>class</code> A when B <code>extends</code> A this's relation called inheritance, and
                        this's makes cod more reuse.</li>

                    name lik usin <code>Math</code> class in javaScript.
                    <br>
                    - we can use <code>this</code> keyword to aadding static method inside member method or inside

                    - when i having aapstracted method this's means i should implement this's method in inherited class or this's will changed the class into abstracted class, this's becouse we thinking about the class which having an abstract method as abstract class.

                    - if we having abstracted class in this's case the abstracted class is still avilable to making object of this's class, and for solving this's problem we should adding <code>new.target == [abstract class name]</code> and check if this's target equall the abstract class or not if condition true in this's case i will thow error, this's condition will added in constructor of the abstract class.
                    <br>
                    - <b>Saled Class :</b> is a class can taking an object of it, but cant inherit of it (the opposit of abstract)- this's one by making condition in opposite way of abstraction condition like this <code>new.target !== [Saled class name]</code> and check if this's target is not equall the Saled class or not, if condition true in this's case i will thow error, this's condition will added in constructor of the Saled class.
